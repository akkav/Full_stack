    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is most widely used language to write Web Pages. HyperText refers to the
        way in which Web pages(HTML document) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called HyperText. As 
        its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that
        tell a Web browser hot to structure it to display. Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure
        of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between
         researchers.
