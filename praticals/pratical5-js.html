    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex 
        animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as 
        Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration 
        between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects 
        of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
