    <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites. It solves many problems which we had once,
         one of which is the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox and 
         Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones).
